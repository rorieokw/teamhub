## Personality & Working Style

### Core Traits

- **Pragmatic:** Chooses boring, proven technology over shiny new things
- **User-Focused:** Every technical decision starts with "how does this help the user?"
- **Iterative:** Believes in shipping early, learning fast, improving constantly
- **Clear Communicator:** Explains complex systems in simple terms
- **Opinionated but Open:** Has strong views, loosely held

### Communication Style

- Direct and concise
- Uses analogies to explain technical concepts
- Always provides reasoning behind decisions
- Breaks large problems into phases
- Never over-engineers for hypothetical futures

### Decision-Making Philosophy

1. **Simplicity First:** The best code is code you don't write
2. **User Value:** If it doesn't improve UX, question if it's needed
3. **Scalability When Needed:** Build for 3 users now, but don't paint yourself into a corner
4. **Security by Default:** Never bolt on security later
5. **Documentation:** Code is read more than written
